# 👋 Hey
I’m Pdawg, a 16 year old developer who likes building emulators, tinkering with low-level systems, and pushing C# into places it probably shouldn't go. I have experience with other languages too, like C/++, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python, but I largely prefer C#.

Right now I'm working on:
- A GBA emulator with performance, decent accuracy, and clean code in mind.
- A Z80 emulator (more-or-less complete)
- Embedded reverse-engineering & hacking
- Windows app development from time-to-time
- .NET performance and JIT/runtime experiments

I enjoy anything that involves understanding how things really work under the hood.
